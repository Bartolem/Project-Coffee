## Description
The heart of this project is the coffee machine. This machine has made brewing coffee simple. The user can choose the type of coffee. Remember that the ingredients needed to create this drink are gradually running out, so they must be refilled.

## How to use
1. On the navigation bar, click on the make coffee tab.
